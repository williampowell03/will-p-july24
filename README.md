The Personal Loan Calculator App is a Java Script Application that allows the user to calculate the Monthly Payment that arises from a loan of their choosing.
The Java Script backend and HTML & CSS front end enables the user to input the loan amount in Â£, the interest rate % and the payment term length in months, producing an output displaying the monthly payment that the user will incur as a result of the loan.

This application utilises a simple formula in order to calculate the interest and the fixed monthly payment with a user interface that aims to display:
* User input box for the Loan Amount Value
* User input box for the Interest Rate Value
* User input box for the Months to Pay Term
* Output showing the monthly payment for the user
